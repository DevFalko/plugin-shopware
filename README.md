# VerignAiPhilosSearch
## About VerignAiPhilosSearch
This plugin provides an implementation of the [aiPhilos](https://aiphilos.com) product search for the [Shopware](https://shopware.com/) eCommerce platform.

It provides synchronization between the Shopware product database and the aiPhilos database. It supports multiple shops and languages (one DB per shop/language, aiPhilos itself only supports german so far).

Search results are retrieved via the aiPhilos but Shopware's default DBAL search is still used and required.

Compatibility with other plugins that decorate or replace the search is not guaranteed.
